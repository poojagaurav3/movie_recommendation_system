Movie Recommendation Systems is implemented from scratch using collaborative filtering by implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and then the approach is revised using the matrix factorization method.

## Dataset
The dataset used is Movie lens dataset, it covers more than 25 million ratings from over 270,000 users. The data is separated into two sets: the first set consists of a list of movies with their overall ratings and features such as budget, revenue, cast, etc. After removing duplicates in the data, we have 19,847,742 different movies.
